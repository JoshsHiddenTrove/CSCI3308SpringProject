The repo is orginized  the front end of jack and alan in folders each labeled as such then henries swiping feature in its own folders.
Gavin has his code in App Source code and unorginized in the reposity as just files. The back end with me and brandon have our files unorginzied throughout the 
reposity simply labeled as what theya re used for.
We built the code by starting with the scraping and front end design then created the database with the webscraping and finally had gavin and
henry intergrate the front and back end then used users to test out particular features asking them to do tasks and seeing if they could
fullfil them without any issues. We did not end up using CI.
